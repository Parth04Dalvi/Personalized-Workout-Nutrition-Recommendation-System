Personalized Workout & Nutrition Recommendation System

ðŸ’¡ About the Project
This project is a Personalized Workout & Nutrition Recommendation System designed to help users achieve their fitness goals. By collecting key user data, such as age, weight, height, and fitness goals, the system generates customized workout routines and daily nutrition plans. The core of the application lies in its backend logic, which uses standard metabolic formulas to calculate calorie and macronutrient needs, then recommends an exercise and meal plan tailored to the individual.

âœ¨ Features
User Profile Management: Create and update a personalized profile with all the necessary information.

Dynamic Recommendations: Receive a unique workout and nutrition plan based on your specific goals (e.g., muscle gain, weight loss, maintenance).

Workout Plans: Get a detailed workout routine with recommended exercises, sets, and repetitions.

Nutrition Plans: Receive a breakdown of your daily calorie and macronutrient targets (protein, carbs, fats) and sample meal suggestions.

API Endpoints: A RESTful API to manage user data and fetch recommendations.
